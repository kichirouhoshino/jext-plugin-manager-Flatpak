# Flatpak package for [Jext Plugin Manager](https://spartacus04.github.io/jext-reborn/) by spartacus04

You can install it from my personal flatpak repo (remove the --user argument to install system-wide)
``` bash
flatpak remote-add --user roddy-flatpak https://kichirouhoshino.github.io/roddy-flatpaks/index.flatpakrepo
flatpak install roddy-flatpak io.github.spartacus04.jext-plugin-manager
```
